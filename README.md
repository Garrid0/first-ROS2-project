# ROS 2 "Bump and Go" Demo

This project provides a simple demonstration of a reactive navigation algorithm known as "Bump and Go." It shows a simulated [TurtleBot3](https://www.turtlebot.com/turtlebot3/) robot in a TurtleBot3 world, controlled by a ROS 2 node written in Python. The robot uses its LIDAR sensor to detect obstacles and changes its direction when it gets too close.

## Features

- **Algorithm:** Simple "Bump and Go" logic.
- **Robot:** TurtleBot3 Burger.
- **Environment:** TurtleBot3 world.
- **Framework:** ROS 2 Humble.
- **Simulator:** Gazebo.
- **Visualization:** RViz2.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you only need a Linux system (Ubuntu 22.04 is recommended) with **Docker** installed.

1.  **Install Docker Engine:**
    Follow the official installation guide for your operating system.
    - [Docker installation instructions for Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

2.  **Manage Docker as a non-root user (Recommended):**
    To avoid using `sudo` for every Docker command, add your user to the `docker` group.
    ```bash
    sudo groupadd docker
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    ```
    After running this, you must **log out and log back in** or **reboot your machine** for the group changes to take effect.

**That's it!** You do not need to install ROS 2, Gazebo, or any other dependencies on your host machine. Everything is self-contained within the Docker container.
